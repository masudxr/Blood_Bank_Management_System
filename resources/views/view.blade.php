                COLLECTION OF BLOOD:
            </h1>
            <p class="mb-2">
                Prior to blood donation, we do a screening process of the donor which consists of confidential medical examinations including medical history, hemoglobin examination, blood pressure, weight , pulse and temperature check . Then, a small amount of blood sample is taken for grouping, check for infectious diseases and cross matching. If all tests are okay then the donor is asked to donate blood. All our materials used in blood donation are strictly sterile and disposable. </p>
            <p>
                Single Donor Apheresis Platelet (SDP) are prepared by connecting the donor to a machine and selectively collecting the platelet and returning the remaining blood components back to the donor.
